</p><p><br /> This is a DOS like prototype for an app to facilitate password management. You can generate passwords that are secure with keys that are easy to rememeber.

Manuallly generating passwords is tedious, and the passwords are hard to remember. Browsers have automatic solutions that seem fine until they lock you out. This is a hybrid solution. You can use it with your password manager if you like.
