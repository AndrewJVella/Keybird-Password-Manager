-WELCOME TO KEYBIRD-
You need lots of passwords, but making them is tedious.
Repeating passwords reduces their effectiveness.
In-browser managers are fine until they lock you out.
You may ask yourself:
"What was my password again?"
"Why does Safari fill in the wrong info?"
"Did I make this account on Google?"
Skip that nonsense, use Keybird.

Keybird is designed to generate
and store passwords on your computer.
While other managers integrate with your browser,
they are much better for accumulating passwords
than actually managing them. At worst you can become
dependant on a specific browser to access your stuff.
At best you might still use a small number of passwords
you wrote yourself for the important stuff,
which puts the important stuff at risk.

My thinking is that 100 auto-generated passwords is bad,
a small number of manually created passwords is worse,
and both of these together is what often happens.
Instead of coming up with a few compilcated
passwords and using them everywhere,
depending on a browser extension,
or (most likely) both

This generates secure passwords from simple keys,
that are easy to create and remember.

Disclaimer
So, in plain terms, this app should be used with some
care. It is about as secure as a basket of keys. If
you keep it behind a locked door, your keys should
stay put because only trusted people get anywhere near
them. By analogy this app is the basket, and your computer
is the door. You should be sure that your computer
is secured and safe before using this app. No information
produced in whole or part by this app is garenteed
to be perfectly safe. Your files can be read, modified,
or deleted. The app source code can also be read, modfied,
or deleted, which would cause unpredictable effects
while running the app. Back up important things; store
your passwords in a few safe places. Keep untrustworthy
people off your computer. Do not store your passwords
publicly, or generate them with keys that are easy
to guess. Stay safe!
