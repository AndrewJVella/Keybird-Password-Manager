This application is designed to generate and
store passwords on your computer. While other managers
integrate with your browser, they are much better for
accumulating passwords than actually managing them.
At worst you can become dependant on a specific browser
to access your stuff. At best you might still use a
small number of passwords you wrote yourself for the
important stuff, which puts the important stuff at
risk.

My thinking is that 100 auto-generated passwords is
bad, a small number of manually created passwords is
worse, and both of these together is what often happens.
Instead of coming up with a few compilcated passwords
and using them everywhere, depending on a browser extension,
or (most likely) both. This generates secure passwords
from simple keys, that are easy to create and remember.

You may need to extract all files before using the application.
